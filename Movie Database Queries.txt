#Examples are from the Udemy course SQL for Data Analysis:  Weekender Crash Course
#The course provided a database based on a movie store concept.  
#There were 23 various tables related to movie details, store inventory and customer data.
#Exercises invloved pulling data from the various tables to evaluate details about movies and stores.
#A site called sqlsnack.com was provided for running SQL against the prepopulated data.
#Anyone may create an account there and run these queries
